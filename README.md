    It is possible to make buildings by stringing together patterns, in a rather loose way. A building made 
    like this is an assembly of patterns. It is not dense. It is not profound. But it is also possible to put 
    patterns together in such a way that many patterns overlap in the same physical space: the building is 
    very dense; it has many meanings captured in a small space; and through this density, it becomes profound.
