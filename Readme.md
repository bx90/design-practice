    It is possible to make buildings by stringing together patterns, in a rather loose way. A building made like this, 
    is an assembly of patterns. It is not dense. It is not profound. But it is also possible to put patterns together 
    in such a way that many patterns overlap in the same physical space: the building is very dense; it has many 
    meanings captured in a small space; and through this density, it becomes profound.
